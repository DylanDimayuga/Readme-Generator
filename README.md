  ## Installation
  To install this application, you just need to follow my github profile in the questions section, copy over the index.js file and generateMarkdown file, then run node in the terminal.
  
  ## Usage
  To use this application you will first create a json package using npm init. Following this you will copy over the two js files. Lastly you will want to make sure you do npm i inquirer to install the proper utils that the js files are using. After all this you will just go into the terminal and type "node index.js". Then your read.me will get generated to the folder you are currently in.

  Or follow the video below on how the application functions.
